### Cooperation Plan

#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Robb enjoys working with functionality and logic of coding. Examples include working with loops. Robb also likes asking questions and ensuring we are doing what we set out todo.

He also wants to get better with CSS and clean profesional presentation.

Jallow likes to work with logical operation and using arrays. Data manipulation. The concepts of events. Jallow wants to get better at using CSS and develop clean presentable websites. He also wants to increase his typing speed. Also working in a team setting and ability to collaborate.

Shane likes using the CSS and experimenting with user interface/design. Organized. Shane wants to better develop his ability to create an initial plan before diving into the action of coding. Shane wants to also increase technical understanding.


#### Day to day workplan

- Always allow for lunch break (as soon as 12 and not later than 2)
- Flexible breaks, take em if you need em.
- 6 end time.
- Thursday - Sunday
- available on weekends to chat

### Conflict Plan

- When a conflict arises, we will put everything that we are doing down and talk about the issue as a team. This will make sure everyone is on the same page. 
- If someone wants to develop a specific skill set we will make sure they get a sufficient amount of time doing so.
- If someone is not contributing, there may be something that is causing that issue outside of the project. We never know.
- A certain amount of work needs to be done over a week. This does not mean the same amount of work needs to be done each day.
- Use of trellow or other workflow organizational system to have clear tasks.
- Use of standup meetings.
- If we cant reach someone for a full day. Ghosted.

### Communication Plan

Hours
- Forsure week day hours 10-6.
- Weekend afternoons

Platfoms
- Slack
- Remo

#### Plan if we start to fall behind?

- If we need to cut features due to time constraint then we will. We will attain the MVP and then build in complexity. Aim is to have MVP by Wednesday.


### Work Plan

- Use of Trellow to define tasks and know what stage they are.
- Standup meetings to better understand the days tasks.

### Git Process

- All of the components of the project will live in the hamshabb organization.


#### Each day

- We will all work on different branches and upload to the Dev branch.
- If you have WIP code, comment out before merging.
- We will have two merge parties. One at the beggining of lunch and then one at the end of the work day.

#### PR review workflow

- People should not be validating their own merge requests. One or more teammates needs to review before.
- Merge before lunch, and at 5:30 each day.
